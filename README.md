# <P align="center"> ExoskeletonWalker - An open design of an exoskeleton walker for children with movement disorders
 
### OBJECTIVES:
<P align="justify"> The objective of the project was to design a low-cost exoskeleton walker for children with movement disorders caused by cerebral palsy 

### BACKGROUND:
<P align="justify"> Children facing movement challenges due to conditions like cerebral palsy often encounter difficulties with walking and may experience feelings of exclusion. Exoskeleton walkers offer a potential solution by providing support for walking and aiding muscle movements. These devices are customizable for each child, potentially contributing to both physical improvement and cognitive development. Beyond the physical benefits, exoskeletons can enhance social interactions, fostering a sense of inclusion and happiness. Early intervention with these walkers may lead to improved long-term outcomes. However, the availability of such walkers is limited, and their cost is high. To address this, we've developed an open-source exoskeleton walker, aiming to make this technology accessible to children worldwide, promoting their well-being and ensuring they can enjoy life like everyone else!</P>

###
- Control box: The control box serves as the central hub for the exoskeleton walker, containing electronic components for controlling and coordinating its operation.
- Arm support: Arm supports provide stability and assistance to the user's arms while operating the exoskeleton walker, ensuring comfort and ease of use.
- Upper chassis: The upper chassis forms the upper framework of the exoskeleton, providing structural support and attachment points for various components.
- Adjustable nuts: Adjustable nuts allow for fine-tuning and customization of the exoskeleton's fit and functionality, enabling adjustments to accommodate different users and preferences.
- Lower chassis: The lower chassis forms the lower framework of the exoskeleton, supporting the user's lower body and providing stability during movement.
- Caster wheel: The caster wheel provides stability and maneuverability to the exoskeleton walker, allowing for smooth and controlled movement on various surfaces.
- Chest guard: The chest guard provides support and protection to the user's chest area, ensuring safety and stability during operation.
- Motor mount: The motor mount securely holds the motors in place, ensuring proper alignment and functionality of the exoskeleton's actuation system.
- Seat: The seat provides a comfortable and supportive platform for the user to sit on while using the exoskeleton walker, allowing for rest or transition between standing and sitting positions.
- Motor shaft: The motor shaft transmits rotational motion from the motor to other components of the exoskeleton, such as gears or pulleys, enabling movement and actuation.
- DOF servo motor: The degree of freedom (DOF) servo motor provides precise control and movement capabilities to specific joints or segments of the exoskeleton, allowing for natural and fluid motion.
- Foot plate: The foot plate serves as the platform for the user's feet, providing stability and support during standing and walking movements, and helping to distribute weight evenly.
