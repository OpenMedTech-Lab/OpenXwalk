# <P align="center"> ExoskeletonWalker - An open design of an exoskeleton walker for children with movement disorders
 
### OBJECTIVES:
<P align="justify"> The objective of the project was to design a low-cost exoskeleton walker for children with movement disorders caused by cerebral palsy 

### BACKGROUND:
<P align="justify"> Children with movement disorders, often stemming from conditions like cerebral palsy and neurological issues, encounter a myriad of challenges, including motor impairments, limited mobility, fine motor skill difficulties, and social and emotional hurdles. Exoskeleton walkers present a promising avenue for improvement in addressing these challenges.Exoskeleton walkers show promise in addressing challenges faced by the children with movement disorders. These devices enhance mobility by providing external support for walking and daily activities, promoting improved gait patterns and muscle engagement. Customizable to individual needs, exoskeletons contribute to therapeutic benefits by facilitating controlled movements, potentially enhancing neuroplasticity. Beyond physical improvements, they positively impact social interactions, fostering inclusion and self-esteem. If early intervention is facilitated during crucial developmental stages a better long-term outcomes are expected. However, there are very few exoskeleton walkers for the children and they are extremely expensive. Hence, we developed an open source exoskeleton walker so that the children anywhere in the world can play using them and grow happily like everyone else!</P>

### DESIGN:
<P align="justify"> The standing wheelchair has nine major parts/components. Each of the parts/components are described in the following:
 
![Block-Diagram](https://github.com/SHOVANPARVEZ/StandingWheelchair-manual/blob/main/Wheelchiar-components.png)

###
- Back support: Conventional wheelchiar back support is use. In addition a chaise belt is attached to the back support to protect the user from falling during the transition to standing position from sitting position.
- Link shaft: The seat and back support of the chair are held erect by link shafts as the chair transforms to the standing position.
- Seat cusion: Conventional seat cusion is used. It does not pose any discomfort to the user either in sitting or standing position.
- Gas spring: Nitrogen oxide gas springs are used to assist the wheelchair in transforming from sitting to standing position.
- Back wheel: Typical wheels that are commonly found in the wheelchairs are used.
- Knee guard: Another essential componet of our standing wheelchiar since it is designed for the users who have no strength in their legs. The knee guards prevent the knee from collapsing and help the users stand upright.
- Base frame: The main frame of the wheelchair that holds every parts of the wheelchair together. Each part can be mounted and unmounted to the base frame which allows low repair costs.
- Front wheel: Castor wheels are used in the front side of the wheelchair. They use a locking system to reduce the risk of the user from falling.
- Footrest: This special footrest is used to support the user's feet while sitting and standing. During the transition from a sitting to a standing position, the footrest height changes to allow safe standing.
 
### DISCLAIMER:
<P align="justify"> The design is offered as it is. Although it has been regorously tested by a number of paraplegic wheelchiar users, we do not provide any warranty in any aspect.

### WARNING:
- The device is intended stricktly for research and education purposes.
- The wheelchiar is not certified for use without receving prior approval from a local safety board or review committee.
